# Build and Run 
If you are using npm modules and want to use this library, contribute, or test:

    npm install
    npm run dev

Wait for the build to complete and a test server will start.

## Examples
Then navigate to **localhost:8000** on a VR enabled browser.



## Notes 
* This module assumes the existence of THREE.js in global scope somewhere.
* Can be used as a drop in script include (like the examples) or as an  ES6 module / node build.
